; Big Integer Operations for Romasm
; Handles arbitrarily large numbers using string/digit array representation
; This bypasses JavaScript's floating-point limits

; Note: These are conceptual implementations
; Full Big Integer support requires string manipulation in the VM

; Big Integer Addition
; Input: Two big integers as digit arrays
; Output: Sum as digit array
bigint_add:
  ; Implementation would handle carry operations digit by digit
  ; Similar to grade-school addition
  RET

; Big Integer Multiplication
; Input: Two big integers
; Output: Product as digit array
bigint_mul:
  ; Implementation would use grade-school multiplication
  ; Or Karatsuba algorithm for efficiency
  RET

; Big Integer Division
; Input: Dividend and divisor
; Output: Quotient and remainder
bigint_div:
  ; Long division algorithm
  RET

; Big Integer Modulo (for odd/even checking)
; Input: Number and modulus (typically 2)
; Output: Remainder
bigint_mod:
  ; Check last digit for mod 2
  ; For mod 2, only need to check if last digit is even
  RET
